LIST COMPREHENSION:
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists 
where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, 
or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition. (www.python.org)

This is a type of 'programming' design pattnern to create an efficient and compact way of repeated implementation.
It is not delivering any new solutions or new data types but rather new syntax to make iteration faster.

syntax:                [expression for item in list if conditional]
                            |                 |             |
for item in list: ----------|-----------------+             |
    if conditional: --------|-------------------------------+
        expression  --------+

numbers = []

for n in range(5):
    numbers.append(n * 2)
print(numbers)
numbers = [n * 2 for n in range(5)] # comprehension

numbers = []
for n in range(5):
    numbers.append(n ** 2)
print(numbers)
numbers = [n ** 2 for n in range(5)] # comprehension
print(numbers)

# store the first letter of each word to another list
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]
items = [word[0] for word in listOfWords ]
Items = [word[0].upper() for word in listOfWords ]


''' you can think of this as a function returning the iterators.. 
that is iteratorable = (for n in range(5))
then do something with the iteratorable (x ** 2, or x * 2, x % 2 etc...)
Finally, these will be stored in to another list (numbers)

The same principle applies to the dictionary

Since Python allows empty lines within {} and [], take advantage of it.
Please note that make the comprehension reading comprehensible and don’t abuse them
I highly recommend writing your comprehensions over multiple lines. 
Comprehensions don’t need to be one-liners to be useful.
